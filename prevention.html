  <div class="sub-title">How HIV spreads</div>
  <div class="text">To become infected with HIV, infected blood, semen or vaginal secretions must enter your body. This can happen in several ways:</div>
  <ul class="text-ul">
    <li style="color: #f91302">
      <div><strong>By having sex.</strong> You may become infected if you have vaginal, anal or oral sex with an infected partner whose blood, semen or vaginal secretions enter your body. The virus can enter your body through mouth sores or small tears that sometimes develop in the rectum or vagina during sexual activity.</div>
    </li>
    <li style="color: #ffc53b" style="">
      <div><strong>By sharing needles.</strong> Sharing contaminated IV drug paraphernalia (needles and syringes) puts you at high risk of HIV and other infectious diseases, such as hepatitis.</div>
    </li>
    <li style="color: #ffeb3b" style="">
      <div><strong>From blood transfusions.</strong> In some cases, the virus may be transmitted through blood transfusions. American hospitals and blood banks now screen the blood supply for HIV antibodies, so this risk is very small.</div>
    </li>
    <li style="color: #4caf50" style="">
      <div><strong>During pregnancy or delivery or through breast-feeding.</strong> Infected mothers can pass the virus on to their babies. Mothers who are HIV-positive and get treatment for the infection during pregnancy can significantly lower the risk to their babies.</div>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <div class="title">For LGBT community, the easiest way to get HIV is sexual intercourse. So how do you avoid getting HIV during sex?</div>
  <div class="text">HIV is spread through contact with blood or sexual fluids (like semen and vaginal fluids), usually during vaginal and anal sex. So the only 100% certain way to avoid HIV is to not have vaginal or anal sex.</div>
  <div class="text">But most people do have sex at some point in their lives, so learning about HIV prevention and knowing how to have safer sex is important. Using condoms REALLY lowers your risk of getting HIV. If you’re going to have sex, using condoms every single time is the best way to protect yourself from HIV. There’s also a daily pill you can take — called PrEP — that can help prevent HIV. Your doctor or nurse can tell you if PrEP is right for you.</div>
  <div class="text">Some sexual activities are safer than others when it comes to getting HIV. These activities are “no risk” — they’ve never caused a reported case of HIV:</div>
  <ul class="text-ul" style="margin-left: 18px;">
    <li>masturbating</li>
    <li>touching your partner’s genitals</li>
    <li>rubbing your bodies together (dry humping)</li>
    <li>kissing</li>
    <li>having oral sex with a condom or dental dam </li>
    <li>using clean sex toys</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="text">These activities are “lower risk” — they’ve only caused a few reported cases of HIV (out of millions):</div>
  <ul class="text-ul" style="margin-left: 18px;">
    <li>"French” or deep kissing (if the person with HIV has sores or bleeding in their mouth)</li>
    <li>vaginal sex with a condom and/or PrEP</li>
    <li>anal sex with a condom and/or PrEP</li>
    <li>oral sex without a condom or dental dam</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="text">These activities are “high risk” — millions of people get HIV this way:</div>
  <ul class="text-ul" style="margin-left: 18px;">
    <li>vaginal sex without a condom or PrEP</li>
    <li>anal sex without a condom or PrEP</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="text">It’s easier for HIV to get into your body if you have sores, cuts, or openings in your skin that semen (cum), vaginal fluids, or blood may get into. So don’t have sex if you have a herpes outbreak or other infections. Having other STDs makes you more likely to get HIV, so it’s a good idea to get tested for STDs regularly.</div>
  <div class="text">There’s no vaccine that protects against HIV, but lots of people are working on making one. And there are medicines (called PEP and PrEP) that can help prevent HIV.</div>
  <div class="text">If you don’t have HIV and your partner does, they can get on an HIV treatment called antiretroviral therapy (ART). ART can lower their chance of spreading HIV during sex. And some people who are on ART can’t transmit HIV to their partner at all.</div>
